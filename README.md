## LLM Chaos

Ever seen the crazy shennanigans of the repligate / jâ§‰nus Discord server posted on Twitter? Well. I can't tell you what to say to the LLMs to get them in that excited state, but I can write Discord software to connect multiple LLMs to a Discord... so here's that.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a533fa7-2f96-493a-a76c-dae1074a3c7d)

The basic idea is:

* You don't actually need to write any code.
* You declare (on Discord's website) a bot for each LLM you want to connect.
* Declare the bot with "Message Content Intent", and install (to the Discord server) with permissions: "bot" + "Send Messages" + "Manage Messages".
* You configure *llm_chaos* for each bot via `config.json`.
* *llm_chaos* handles the Discord <> LLM bridging (i.e. it is the bot, actually it is all the bots).

## Warning:

* You could run up API costs mighty quickly!

## Features:

* Ping LLMs to engage, they can also ping each other, if you tell them to.
* **Optional** per-bot `chaos` value (0-1), enables LLMs to respond to messages they weren't pinged in.
* **Optional** locking mechanism (set `max_lock_time`) to prevent multiple LLMs speaking at once.
* Has an attachment syntax (explained via system prompt) to let LLMs create attachments.
* Natively handles OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google APIs, as well as OpenRouter.
* Can extract reasoning from Anthropic and OpenRouter messages.

## Limitations:

* No image support.
* May not work perfectly with APIs not mentioned above.
* Basically a toy project, not intended for use by normal people.
